# Test-Stats

At Coinhouse we use drone for our continuous integration. This tool gives some stats on runtimes of your tests that run on drone.io

## Getting Started

1. Get your personal token from your drone ci server: `https://<URL>/account`

2. Add the necessary elements to your .env file.


```
# .env file
TOKEN=asdlkfj1234lk
URL=https://ci.somesite.com
USER=unflores
REPO=test-stats
STAGE_NAMES_REGEX=some_stage|another_stage # There are many stages for a build, you can group multiple testing stages together to get their times
```

3. Build and run:
```
npx tsc && node dist/index.js
```

4. Take generated csv `./runtimes.csv` and make a graph from it

# Tests

```
npm run test
```
